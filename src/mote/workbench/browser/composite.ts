 *
 * The workbench will keep a composite alive after it has been created and show/hide it based on
 * user interaction. The lifecycle of a composite goes in the order create(), setVisible(true|false),
 * layout(), focus(), dispose(). During use of the workbench, a composite will often receive a setVisible,
